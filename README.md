## <i class="fas fa-briefcase fa-fw"></i> Employment
- 2023 - present: **[ftsrg@BME](https://ftsrg.mit.bme.hu/en/)**, Budapest, HUN, Research Fellow  
  
  _Design and performance analysis of DLT-based solutions._ Currently, the main focus points of my research are: i) the knowledge-base supported performance monitoring and analysis of service-oriented (mainly DLT) systems; ii) the model-based design of DLT smart contracts; and iii) privacy-aware data model design for DLT smart contracts.
- 2020 - 2022: **[ftsrg@BME](https://ftsrg.mit.bme.hu/en/)**, Budapest, HUN, Research Assistant  
  
  _Performance analysis of distributed ledger solutions._ The scope of my research during this period was the rigorous measurement-based performance analysis of DLT frameworks. The main focus of my work was the systematic performance measurement and analysis of the Hyperledger Fabric DLT platform, including the detailed supporting methodologies across the entire life-cycle of the measurement campaign.

## <i class="fas fa-solid fa-brackets-curly fa-fw"></i> Projects
- 2023 - present: **Ongoing projects @ ftsrg**  
  
  _Technical lead, system design and consultation._ I provide technical-level system design and consultation for ongoing projects concerning DLT-based data management solutions.
- 2020 - present: **Development and performance assessment of a CBDC prototype system @ ftsrg**  
  
  _Lead technical expert of the smart contract development and the performance assessment tracks._ I partially designed and developed components of a multi-tier, DLT-based prototype system for the handling of central bank digital currency (CBDC). Moreover, I was the lead technical expert of the research track targeting the performance measurement and assessment of the prototype. This work was created under the Cooperation Agreement between the Hungarian National Bank (MNB) and the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME) in the Digitisation, artificial intelligence and data age workgroup.
- 2018 - 2019: **Fault Injection of Blockchain Systems @ ftsrg**   
  
  _Key participant in research and development._ The project targeted the performance and robustness assessment of the Hyperledger Fabric platform in the presence of faulty smart contracts, achieved using software fault injection. I designed and implemented the deployment, measurement, and workload generation aspects of the project. Furthermore, I was a key participant in the analysis of the gathered measurement data.

## <i class="fas fa-desktop fa-fw"></i> Tools / Opensource
- 2021 - present: **Hyperledger Caliper @ Linux/Hyperledger Foundation** [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper)

  _Maintainer/principal developer._ Caliper is an open-source, scalable, and flexible tool for the benchmarking of blockchain technologies, governed by the Linux Foundation. I am among the principal developers of the project, shaping its architecture and feature set, following best practices I gather during my own research.
- 2018 Oct. - present: **TPC-C for Hyperledger Fabric @ ftsrg** [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/ftsrg/blockchain-benchmarks-tpcc) [<i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i>](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3477314.3507006)  
  
  _Benchmark port design and development._ I designed and developed a Hyperledger Fabric smart contract as the implementation of the standard TPC-C performance benchmark specification. Furthermore, I also implemented the corresponding workload generation using Hyperledger Caliper.
- 2011 - 2016: **PetriDotNet @ ftsrg** [<i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i>](https://inf.mit.bme.hu/research/tools/petridotnet)   
  
  _Design and development._ PetriDotNet is a modeling framework for editing, simulating and analyzing Petri nets. I researched, designed and implemented modular and scalable linear algebra algorithms (using .NET, C\#, MEF), provided a graphical interface for a configurable model analysis workflow (using WinForms), and thoroughly unit tested the related algorithms (using IntelliTest, combinatorial testing, interval testing, and test generation techniques).

## <i class="fas fa-globe fa-fw"></i> Mentoring / Internships
- 2023 June - Nov.: **[Summer Mentorship Program @ Hyperledger](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN)**  
  
  _Mentor._ I'm mentoring two projects related to mostly Hyperledger Fabric. The first project's goal is to aid the work of smart contract developers by providing ORM-like features for designing the data model of the contract. The second project (co-mentored by AMD Singapore) aims to provide a service-oriented solution for the monitoring and performance analysis of Fabric networks.
- 2022 June - Aug.: **[Summer Mentorship Program @ Hyperledger](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN)**  
  
  _Mentor._ I mentored a university student from the USA who designed and implemented an extension for the Visual Studio Code development environment to facilitate the usage of Hyperledger Caliper for users.
- 2021 June - Aug.: **[Summer Mentorship Program @ Hyperledger](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN)**  
  
  _Mentor._ I mentored a university student from India who designed and implemented a built-in workload module for Hyperledger Caliper that allows users the declarative, configuration file-based definition of workloads instead of directly implementing them in code.
- 2019 June - Aug.: **[Summer Mentorship Program @ Hyperledger](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN)**  
  
  _Mentor._ I co-mentored (with Huawei) a university student from the USA who conducted preliminary work on a GUI component for the Hyperledger Caliper project.
- 2018 Dec.: **[Ph.D. winter school in Jerusalem](https://iias.huji.ac.il/event/3rd-winter-school-computer-science-and-engineering-blockchains-and-cryptocurrencies)**
  
  _Participant._ I participated in the _3rd Advanced School in Computer Science and Engineering: Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies_ Ph.D. winter school, organized in Jerusalem, Israel.
- 2017 June - Aug.: **[Summer Mentorship Program @ Hyperledger](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN)**  
  
  _Intern._ I researched and prototyped an approach for the automatic execution of business processes on the Hyperledger Fabric DLT platform. I applied standard- and model-based development techniques (BPMN, Petri nets, state machines), model transformation frameworks (Eclipse, Java, EMF, ATL), and model-based code generation (Xtend, Golang).
